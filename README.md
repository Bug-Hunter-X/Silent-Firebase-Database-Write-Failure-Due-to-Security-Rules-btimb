This repository demonstrates a common and frustrating issue encountered when interacting with the Firebase Realtime Database: silent failures due to restrictive security rules.  The `bug.js` file contains code that attempts a write operation which fails silently, and `bugSolution.js` shows how to fix this by properly configuring security rules and handling errors effectively.  This often leads to debugging challenges because the application doesn't provide explicit error feedback. This example focuses on improving error handling and clarifying how to correctly implement Firebase security rules.
